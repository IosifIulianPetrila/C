<h1>The C programming language through @C – augmented version of C programming language</h1>

@C is an augmented version of the C programming language that introduces a range of low-level and high-level augmentations/facilities designed to expand the language’s applicability across diverse computing systems, operations, and current programmers’ needs. The @C approach preserves the spirit and core characteristics of standard C through full compatibility, while also rejuvenating the language and bringing it closer to the state of the art found in modern programming languages.
